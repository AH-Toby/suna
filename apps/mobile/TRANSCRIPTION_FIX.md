# Voice Transcription - Critical Fix Applied

## THE PROBLEM

React Native's FormData **reads file URIs asynchronously** during the fetch request, not when you create the FormData. This means:

1. Recording stops ‚Üí File saved to disk
2. FormData created with file URI ‚Üí **File reference stored, but NOT read yet**
3. `transcribeAudio()` called ‚Üí Fetch starts
4. Fetch tries to read file ‚Üí **FILE ALREADY DELETED** ‚Üí ‚ùå Error

## THE SOLUTION

**Read the file into memory IMMEDIATELY** as base64, then convert to Blob, BEFORE sending:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ NOW: Read file into memory IMMEDIATELY
const base64 = await FileSystem.readAsStringAsync(audioUri, {
  encoding: 'base64',
});

// Convert base64 to Blob (now safely in memory)
const byteCharacters = atob(base64);
const byteArray = new Uint8Array(byteCharacters.length);
for (let i = 0; i < byteCharacters.length; i++) {
  byteArray[i] = byteCharacters.charCodeAt(i);
}
const blob = new Blob([byteArray], { type: mimeType });

// Now we can safely send it - file can be deleted anytime
formData.append('audio_file', blob, filename);
```

## WHAT CHANGED

### 1. Installed `expo-file-system`
```bash
npx expo install expo-file-system
```

### 2. Updated `transcription.ts`
- Added `import * as FileSystem from 'expo-file-system'`
- Read file into base64 immediately
- Convert base64 ‚Üí Blob ‚Üí FormData
- File is now in memory BEFORE fetch starts

### 3. Other Fixes Applied
- ‚úÖ Fixed double-deletion guard in `useAudioRecorder.ts`
- ‚úÖ Fixed undefined trigger type in `trigger-utils.ts`

## HOW IT WORKS NOW

```
1. User presses üé§ ‚Üí Recording starts
2. User speaks ‚Üí Waveform animates  
3. User presses ‚èé ‚Üí Recording stops
4. File read into memory ‚Üí Base64 ‚Üí Blob
5. Transcription sent ‚Üí "Transcribing..." shown
6. Text appears in input ‚Üí User can edit
7. User presses ‚èé again ‚Üí Message sent
```

## TESTING

1. Reload the app (shake ‚Üí "Reload" or press `r`)
2. Open a chat
3. Tap üé§ microphone
4. Speak for 2-5 seconds
5. Tap ‚èé send button
6. Watch for "Transcribing..."
7. Verify text appears in input

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

**API Endpoint**: `POST https://staging-api.suna.so/api/transcription`
- Accepts: `audio_file` (form-data, multipart/form-data)
- Formats: audio/m4a, audio/mp3, audio/wav, audio/webm
- Backend: OpenAI Whisper API
- Max size: 25MB

**Files Modified**:
1. `apps/mobile/lib/chat/transcription.ts` - File reading fix
2. `apps/mobile/hooks/media/useAudioRecorder.ts` - Double-deletion guard
3. `apps/mobile/lib/utils/trigger-utils.ts` - Undefined check
4. `apps/mobile/package.json` - Added expo-file-system

**Logs to Watch**:
```
üìñ Reading file into base64...
‚úÖ File read into memory: 45234 chars
‚úÖ Blob created: 33926 bytes
‚úÖ FormData created with audio blob
üì§ Uploading audio for transcription
üì° Transcription response status: 200
‚úÖ Transcription successful
üìù Transcribed text: "Your words here"
```

## STATUS

‚úÖ **Critical file deletion bug FIXED**
‚úÖ All linting passes
‚úÖ expo-file-system installed
‚úÖ Expo restarted with clean cache
‚úÖ Ready for testing on physical device/simulator

## WHY THIS WORKS

The key insight: **React Native's networking layer reads files lazily**.

- ‚ùå **Before**: FormData stores URI ‚Üí Fetch reads file later ‚Üí File deleted ‚Üí Error
- ‚úÖ **After**: Read file NOW ‚Üí Store in memory ‚Üí Fetch sends memory ‚Üí Success

This is a well-known React Native limitation with file uploads. The solution is always to read files into memory (base64/Blob) BEFORE creating FormData.
